# Scrolling Behavior and Keyboard Handling Optimizations

## Overview

This document outlines the optimizations made to the MarkdownEditor component to improve scrolling behavior and keyboard handling, addressing the requirements in task 7.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Selection Handling Optimization

**Problem**: Previous implementation used `setTimeout` with 10ms delays that could interfere with natural scrolling.

**Solution**: 
- Reduced timeout delays to 0ms using `setTimeout(..., 0)` for immediate execution in next tick
- Added timeout reference management to clear pending selection updates
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` for mode switching to ensure smooth transitions

```typescript
// Before
setTimeout(() => {
  setSelection(newSelection);
  textInputRef.current?.setSelection?.(newCursorPosition, newCursorPosition);
}, 10);

// After
selectionTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
  const newSelection = { start: newCursorPosition, end: newCursorPosition };
  setSelection(newSelection);
  textInputRef.current?.setSelection?.(newCursorPosition, newCursorPosition);
  selectionTimeoutRef.current = null;
}, 0);
```

### 2. TextInput Scrolling Optimizations

**Optimizations Applied**:
- `scrollEnabled={true}` - Ensures native scrolling is enabled
- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"` - Prevents keyboard dismissal during scrolling
- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator={true}` - Provides visual feedback for scrolling
- `blurOnSubmit={false}` - Maintains focus during multiline editing

**Platform-Specific Optimizations**:
- **iOS**: 
  - `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets={false}` - Prevents automatic content adjustments
  - `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="never"` - Disables automatic inset adjustments
- **Android**: 
  - `underlineColorAndroid="transparent"` - Removes default underline

### 3. ScrollView Optimizations for Preview Mode

**Performance Optimizations**:
- `removeClippedSubviews={true}` - Improves performance by removing off-screen views
- `maxToRenderPerBatch={10}` - Limits rendering batch size
- `windowSize={10}` - Optimizes virtual scrolling window
- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"` - Consistent keyboard behavior

### 4. Style Optimizations

**Removed Constraints**:
- Removed `minHeight: 400` from TextInput styles to allow natural content sizing
- Changed preview content to use `flexGrow: 1` instead of fixed `minHeight`

**Benefits**:
- Allows content to determine natural height
- Prevents artificial scrolling constraints
- Improves responsiveness for small and large documents

### 5. Memory Management

**Cleanup Implementation**:
- Added cleanup for selection timeout references on component unmount
- Prevents memory leaks from pending timeouts

```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (selectionTimeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(selectionTimeoutRef.current);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

## Requirements Addressed

### Requirement 1.1: Smooth and Natural Scrolling
- ✅ Enabled native scrolling with `scrollEnabled={true}`
- ✅ Removed artificial height constraints
- ✅ Optimized selection handling to minimize interference

### Requirement 1.2: No Automatic Scrolling Override
- ✅ Disabled automatic content inset adjustments on iOS
- ✅ Removed custom scrolling logic
- ✅ Let native TextInput handle scroll positioning

### Requirement 1.3: Proper Keyboard Handling
- ✅ Added `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"`
- ✅ Set `blurOnSubmit={false}` for multiline editing
- ✅ Platform-specific keyboard optimizations

### Requirement 1.4: Manual Scroll Respect
- ✅ No custom scroll event handlers that override user input
- ✅ Native scroll behavior preserved
- ✅ Removed automatic scroll position adjustments

### Requirement 1.5: Cursor Visibility During Typing
- ✅ Optimized selection updates with minimal delays
- ✅ Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth mode transitions
- ✅ Maintained `textAlignVertical="top"` for consistent positioning

## Testing Approach

Due to Jest configuration issues in the current environment, manual testing should be performed to verify:

1. **Scrolling Behavior**:
   - Open a long sermon document (1000+ words)
   - Scroll manually through the content
   - Verify smooth scrolling without jumps or stutters
   - Test on both iOS and Android devices

2. **Keyboard Interactions**:
   - Focus the editor and bring up the keyboard
   - Verify the editor adjusts appropriately without disorienting jumps
   - Test typing at different positions in the document
   - Verify cursor remains visible during typing

3. **Formatting Operations**:
   - Select text and apply formatting
   - Verify selection remains stable
   - Test formatting operations don't cause scroll jumps
   - Verify cursor positioning after formatting

4. **Mode Switching**:
   - Switch between markup and preview modes
   - Verify smooth transitions
   - Test with cursor at different positions
   - Verify scroll position is maintained appropriately

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with documents of varying sizes (100 words to 10,000+ words)
   - Verify responsive behavior across document sizes
   - Test memory usage during extended editing sessions

## Implementation Notes

- All optimizations maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to the component API
- Platform-specific optimizations are conditionally applied
- Performance improvements are measurable through reduced timeout delays and optimized rendering

## Future Considerations

- Monitor performance metrics in production
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for extremely large documents (20,000+ words)
- Evaluate user feedback on scrolling behavior improvements
- Consider adding scroll position persistence across app sessions
