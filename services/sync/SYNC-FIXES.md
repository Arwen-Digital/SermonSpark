# Sync Service Fixes

## Issues Addressed

Based on the sync logs showing errors like:
- "Failed to delete sermon caf781ef-e228-4e19-bafb-a440b68bc06e: Sermon not found"
- "Remote sermon fbacbd95-0508-48ff-becc-e3c3561ef6fd references non-existent series f58fe01d-ae8e-427d-a379-ffe5cc123e51"

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Improved 404 Error Handling for Deletions**

**Problem**: Sync was failing when trying to delete records that were already deleted on the server.

**Solution**: Enhanced error detection to treat 404/not found errors as successful deletions:

```typescript
// Before: Would fail with "Sermon not found" error
await httpClient.delete(`/api/sermons/${record.id}`);

// After: Gracefully handles already-deleted records
try {
  await httpClient.delete(`/api/sermons/${record.id}`);
} catch (deleteError) {
  // If sermon is already deleted (404) or not found, treat as success
  if (deleteError instanceof Error && 
      (deleteError.message.includes('404') || 
       deleteError.message.includes('HTTP 404') ||
       deleteError.message.includes('Sermon not found') ||
       deleteError.message.includes('not found'))) {
    console.log(`Sermon ${record.id} already deleted on server, marking as synced locally`);
  } else {
    throw deleteError;
  }
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Series-Sermon Referential Integrity**

**Problem**: Sermons were being synced with references to series that didn't exist locally yet.

**Solution**: Improved handling of missing series references during sermon sync:

```typescript
// Before: Would log warning but continue with invalid reference
if (!seriesExists) {
  console.warn(`Sermon references non-existent series, will sync series first`);
}

// After: Temporarily clears reference and marks for re-sync
if (!seriesExists) {
  console.warn(`Sermon ${remoteRecord.id} references non-existent series ${sqliteData.series_id}, will sync series first`);
  // Temporarily clear the series reference and mark for re-sync
  sqliteData.series_id = null;
  sqliteData.dirty = 1; // Mark as dirty so it gets re-synced after series sync
  console.log(`Temporarily clearing series reference for sermon ${remoteRecord.id}, will be restored after series sync`);
}
```

### 3. **Added Second-Pass Sermon Sync**

**Problem**: Sermons with missing series references weren't being properly restored after series sync.

**Solution**: Added automatic second-pass sync for sermons with missing references:

```typescript
// Check if there are any sermons marked as dirty (possibly due to missing series references)
const dirtySermons = await queryAll<{ id: string }>(
  `SELECT id FROM sermons WHERE user_id = ? AND dirty = 1 AND series_id IS NULL`,
  [userId]
);

if (dirtySermons.length > 0) {
  console.log(`Found ${dirtySermons.length} sermons with missing series references, attempting second sync pass...`);
  
  // Perform a second sermon sync to restore series references
  const secondSermonResult = await syncSermons();
  
  // Merge results with first sync pass
  sermonStats.pushed += secondSermonResult.pushed;
  sermonStats.pulled += secondSermonResult.pulled;
  // ... etc
}
```

### 4. **Fixed TypeScript Nullable Value Issues**

**Problem**: TypeScript errors due to potentially undefined `deleted_at` values.

**Solution**: Added null coalescing for all nullable database fields:

```typescript
// Before: sqliteData.deleted_at (could be undefined)
// After: sqliteData.deleted_at || null (ensures proper null value)
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the sync process should:

1. ✅ **Handle deleted records gracefully** - No more "Sermon not found" errors when trying to delete already-deleted records
2. ✅ **Maintain referential integrity** - Sermons with missing series references will be temporarily cleared and restored after series sync
3. ✅ **Complete successfully** - The sync should report `success: true` instead of `success: false`
4. ✅ **Reduce error count** - Significantly fewer errors in the sync results
5. ✅ **Automatic recovery** - Second-pass sync will restore any missing series references

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Trigger a sync** from the mobile app
2. **Check the logs** for:
   - Reduced error messages
   - "already deleted on server" messages for 404 errors
   - "second sync pass" messages for missing references
   - `success: true` in the final sync result

3. **Verify data integrity**:
   - Sermons should have correct series references after sync
   - No orphaned records should remain
   - All changes should be properly synchronized

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages that indicate the fixes are working:

- `"Sermon X already deleted on server, marking as synced locally"`
- `"Series X already deleted on server, marking as synced locally"`
- `"Temporarily clearing series reference for sermon X"`
- `"Found N sermons with missing series references, attempting second sync pass"`
- `"Second sermon sync completed: X pushed, Y pulled"`

The final sync result should show `"success": true` with minimal or no errors.
