# Latest Sync Fixes - October 9, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ **Issue 1: Second-Pass Sync Not Running**

**Problem**: The logs showed "No dirty sermons found, skipping second sync pass" even though sermons had missing series references.

**Root Cause**: The dirty flag was only being set for new sermon records, not for existing records being updated.

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced the existing record update logic to:
1. Check for missing series references during updates (not just inserts)
2. Temporarily clear the series reference when series doesn't exist
3. Mark the sermon as `dirty = 1` so it gets caught by the second-pass sync
4. Update both DELETE and UPDATE SQL statements to use the dirty flag

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Only logged warning for existing records
if (!seriesExists) {
  console.warn(`Remote sermon references non-existent series, will sync series first`);
  // Continue with the sermon but log the issue
}

// After: Actually handles missing references for existing records
if (!seriesExists) {
  console.warn(`Remote sermon ${remoteRecord.id} references non-existent series ${sqliteData.series_id}, will sync series first`);
  // Temporarily clear the series reference and mark for re-sync
  sqliteData.series_id = null;
  shouldMarkDirty = true;
  console.log(`Temporarily clearing series reference for sermon ${remoteRecord.id}, will be restored after series sync`);
}

// Updated SQL to use dirty flag
`UPDATE sermons SET ... dirty = ?, ... WHERE id = ?`
[..., shouldMarkDirty ? 1 : 0, ...]
```

### ‚úÖ **Issue 2: UI Not Refreshing - Debug Tools Added**

**Problem**: Sync completes successfully but data doesn't appear on phone.

**Debugging Solution**: Added comprehensive debug tools to identify if it's a data storage issue or UI refresh issue.

**Tools Added**:
1. **Automatic Debug Check**: Runs after every sync in development mode
2. **Manual Debug Functions**: Can be called from debugger console
3. **Database Verification**: Checks if data is actually stored in SQLite
4. **Repository Testing**: Verifies if repositories return the synced data

## What You Should See Next

### üîç **In the Sync Logs**

**Second-Pass Sync Should Now Run**:
```
LOG  Found 2 dirty sermons, checking for missing series references...
LOG  Found 2 sermons with missing series references, attempting second sync pass...
LOG  Re-fetching sermon data from server to restore series references...
LOG  Restored series reference for sermon abc123: xyz789
LOG  Restored series references for 2/2 sermons
```

**Automatic Debug Info**:
```
üîç Running complete sync debug check...
=== SYNC DEBUG INFO ===
User ID: your-user-id
Series Count: 2
Sermon Count: 3
Dirty Series: 0
Dirty Sermons: 0  // Should be 0 after successful second pass
Series without Sermons: 0
Sermons without Series: 0  // Should be 0 after series references restored
```

### üõ†Ô∏è **Manual Testing**

If the UI still doesn't refresh, you can manually check the data:

1. **Open React Native Debugger**
2. **In the console, run**: `global.debugSync()`
3. **Check the output** to see if:
   - Data is stored in SQLite database
   - Repositories return the data correctly
   - There are any remaining dirty records

### üì± **Expected UI Behavior**

**If data is in database but UI doesn't refresh**:
- The issue is UI refresh (need to implement completion callback)
- Follow the [UI-REFRESH-GUIDE.md](./UI-REFRESH-GUIDE.md)

**If data is not in database**:
- There's still a sync storage issue
- Check the debug output for clues

## Testing Steps

1. **Trigger a sync** from your phone
2. **Watch for new log messages** about second-pass sync
3. **Check the debug output** that appears automatically
4. **If UI doesn't refresh**, run `global.debugSync()` in debugger
5. **Compare database counts** with what appears in UI

## Next Actions Based on Results

### ‚úÖ **If Second-Pass Sync Runs Successfully**
- Series references should be restored
- No more "references non-existent series" warnings
- `Sermons without Series: 0` in debug output

### ‚úÖ **If Data is in Database but UI Doesn't Refresh**
- Implement the completion callback from [UI-REFRESH-GUIDE.md](./UI-REFRESH-GUIDE.md)
- The sync is working, just need to notify the UI

### ‚ùå **If Data is Still Not in Database**
- Check for any remaining error messages
- Run manual debug to see what's happening
- May need further sync logic fixes

## Files Modified

- `syncService.native.ts` - Fixed dirty flag handling for existing records
- `debug-sync-data.ts` - Comprehensive debug utilities
- `manual-debug.ts` - Manual testing functions
- `LATEST-FIXES.md` - This summary

The sync should now properly handle series references and provide clear debugging information!
