# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current sermon editor has significant usability issues with scrolling behavior and text selection/editing responsiveness. Users experience unnatural scrolling that interferes with writing flow, and text selection operations don't respond immediately as expected. This feature aims to replace or significantly improve the current markdown editor implementation to provide a smooth, responsive writing experience that feels natural and intuitive.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sermon writer, I want smooth and natural scrolling behavior in the editor, so that I can focus on writing without being distracted by erratic scrolling movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scroll through the editor content THEN the scrolling SHALL be smooth and responsive without jumping or stuttering
2. WHEN I type new content THEN the editor SHALL NOT automatically scroll unless the cursor moves out of the visible area
3. WHEN the keyboard appears THEN the editor SHALL adjust its view appropriately without causing disorienting scroll jumps
4. WHEN I manually scroll THEN the editor SHALL NOT override my scroll position with automatic scrolling
5. IF I am typing at the end of a long document THEN the editor SHALL smoothly keep the cursor visible without aggressive scrolling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a sermon writer, I want immediate and responsive text selection and editing, so that I can efficiently format and modify my content without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select text THEN the selection SHALL appear immediately without delay
2. WHEN I apply formatting to selected text THEN the formatting SHALL be applied instantly and the selection SHALL remain stable
3. WHEN I tap to place the cursor THEN the cursor SHALL appear at the exact position I tapped without delay
4. WHEN I use formatting buttons THEN the text changes SHALL be applied immediately and the cursor position SHALL be maintained appropriately
5. IF I select text and then type THEN the selected text SHALL be replaced immediately with the new text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sermon writer, I want a reliable markdown editor that handles both markup and preview modes effectively, so that I can write in markdown syntax and see formatted results as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between markup and preview modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and maintain my cursor position
2. WHEN I type markdown syntax THEN the preview mode SHALL render the formatting correctly
3. WHEN I use formatting toolbar buttons THEN the appropriate markdown syntax SHALL be inserted at the cursor position
4. WHEN I have text selected and use formatting buttons THEN the selected text SHALL be wrapped with the appropriate markdown syntax
5. IF the current editor implementation cannot be fixed THEN a proven third-party markdown editor library SHALL be evaluated and implemented

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a sermon writer, I want consistent editor behavior across different devices and screen sizes, so that my writing experience is reliable regardless of the device I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the editor on mobile devices THEN the touch interactions SHALL be responsive and accurate
2. WHEN I use the editor on tablets or larger screens THEN the editor SHALL take advantage of the additional screen space effectively
3. WHEN I rotate my device THEN the editor SHALL adapt smoothly without losing cursor position or content
4. WHEN I use the editor on web platforms THEN keyboard shortcuts and mouse interactions SHALL work as expected
5. IF there are platform-specific issues THEN they SHALL be addressed with appropriate platform-specific implementations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a sermon writer, I want the editor to maintain good performance even with long documents, so that I can write extensive sermons without experiencing lag or slowdowns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I work with documents over 10,000 words THEN the editor SHALL remain responsive
2. WHEN I scroll through long documents THEN the scrolling SHALL remain smooth without performance degradation
3. WHEN I perform text operations on large documents THEN the operations SHALL complete without noticeable delay
4. WHEN the editor renders formatted text THEN it SHALL do so efficiently without blocking the UI
5. IF performance issues arise with large documents THEN optimization techniques SHALL be implemented to maintain responsiveness
