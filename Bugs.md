## High Priority

### 游댮 Sermon Editor Crashes on Android

- **Platform:** Android
- **Description:** The sermon editor crashes when opened on Android devices
- **Reproduction:**
  1. Open the app on Android
  2. Navigate to create/edit a sermon
  3. App crashes
- **Status:** Fixed

- **Assigned:** TBD
- **Date Reported:** 2025-09-27

### 游댮 Sermon Editor Not Functional Offline

- **Platform:** iOS/Android
- **Description:** The sermon editor fails to load when the mobile app is offline because it depends on loading CKEditor from a CDN. Users cannot create or edit sermons without internet connectivity, breaking the app's offline-first design.
- **Reproduction:**
  1. Put device in airplane mode or disconnect from internet
  2. Open the app and navigate to create/edit a sermon
  3. Editor fails to load with "CKEditor failed to load" error
  4. Expected: Editor should work offline with full rich text editing capabilities
  5. Actual: Editor completely fails to initialize, preventing sermon editing
- **Status:** Not fixed
- **Priority:** High
- **Assigned:** TBD
- **Date Reported:** 2025-01-27
- **Additional Notes:**
  - Root cause: Both `CKEditorMobile.tsx` and `CKEditorWeb.tsx` load CKEditor from `https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/40.2.0/super-build/ckeditor.js`
  - The app has robust offline data storage (SQLite) but the editor component breaks offline functionality
  - Solution: Download and bundle CKEditor JavaScript file locally in assets
  - This affects core functionality and contradicts the app's offline-first architecture
  - High impact on user experience as sermon editing is a primary feature

  4. Expected: Layout should be responsive and adapt to landscape orientation
